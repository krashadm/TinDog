# TinDog
A Bootstrap CSS project for a new startup for Dog Tinder. 

This assignment I had to recreate a website that was presented. I was given x sections which I had to create code for. To create the code I used Bootstrap examples to fill the sections. 

In the Title section, I used a Bootstrap Hero. I had to resize the image inside of the Hero. I added SVG icons for download buttons. I styled the buttons with a dark button and a button outline. I had to adjust padding to where it was only present on the top. 

#Features
I used a bootstrap features with hanging icons. I customized the icons to match the example website. 

#Testimonials
This was a jumbotron. I did not create as a jumbotron and retreived the result .
